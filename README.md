# COVID-19 National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Data Analysis

Project Overview: 
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) data. The data is available in four zip files representing the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Objectives: 
● Extract and import the data from the zip files into a SQL database. 
● Clean and transform the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. 
● Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and insights. 
● Perform statistical analysis to understand the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare facilities. 
● Generate meaningful visualizations and reports to present the findings to stakeholders. 
● Identify potential areas for improvement in healthcare practices based on the analysis. 

Data Sources: The data will be sourced from the following URLs: 
2020 data: https://download.cms.gov/covid_nhsn/faclevel_2020.zip 
2021 data: https://download.cms.gov/covid_nhsn/faclevel_2021.zip 
2022 data: https://download.cms.gov/covid_nhsn/faclevel_2022.zip 
2023 data: https://download.cms.gov/covid_nhsn/faclevel_2023.zip 

Methodology: 
● Extract the zip files and import the data into a SQL database. 
● Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to address missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. 
● Explore the data using SQL queries to identify key metrics, trends, and patterns. 
● Conduct statistical analysis to understand the impact of COVID-19 on different healthcare facilities. 
● Utilize SQL functions, aggregations, and joins to derive meaningful insights from the data. 
● Create visualizations and reports using SQL or export the data to external tools for visualization.
